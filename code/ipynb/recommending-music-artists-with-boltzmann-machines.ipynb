As a result, unsupervised learning machines have distinct architectures and functional principles. Traditional concepts found in supervised learning, like forwardfeeding and input / output layers, are not applicable - or have different interpretations - in unsupervised learning.</p>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.2. Boltzmann machines"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Botzmann machines are unsupervised learning neural networks pertaining to a family of solutions not as wide and popularly explored as others: <b>energy based models</b>. Put simply, in energy based models the system under analysis will always self-adapt to changes in its constituent elements in pursuit of the lowest possible overall compounded energy state. This concept is central in several fields of Physics, from thermodynamics to quantum mechanics.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">A traditional Boltzmann machine comprises a finite set of neurons interconnected with each other.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Neurons- or <b>nodes</b> - are in turn subdivided into two specific sets: <b>visible</b> and <b>hidden</b>, as described in the picture below.</p>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/u5G1z1L.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"100\">"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style=\"text-align: justify\">In an analogy with the human body, the author likes to think of <b>visible nodes</b> as the neural terminations we have in our eyes, nose, tongue and skin to capture external stimulus such as images, sounds, smells, tastes and sensations like heat, cold and pain. Accordingly, <b>hidden nodes</b> might be interpreted as the set of neurons in our brains responsible to process the information received from the neural terminations and take action - always aiming at self-adapting and conducting the organism to the most appropriate state - the 'lowest energy' state - for a given set of external circumstances.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">A pictorial example: if the neurons located in the optic nerves on and behind our eyes' retina (the 'visible nodes') experience a sudden increase in external light intensity, this information is quickly delivered to the neurons located in the brain's occipital lobe (the 'hidden nodes') who, in turn, process this information and 'instruct' the eye muscles to constrict pupils, so that the amount of light  reaching the retina is reduced and retina cells are preserved. The overall organism optical network is thus taken to a new optimal 'state' that will last until the environment perceived by the visible nodes change again.</p>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style=\"text-align: justify\">In a Boltzmann machine, all nodes are connected to each other. However, the adoption of such architecture in practical implementations demands higher processing and memory assignment capabilities, reason why a simplified version of Boltzmann machines - so called Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) - gained traction and became widely used. In RBMs, connections between visible nodes and hidden nodes are maintained, while connections among visible nodes and connections among hidden nodes are eliminated, as illustrated below.</p>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kNI7eLL.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"100\">"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The relationship between visible and hidden nodes is governed by the weights of the corresponding connections.

The model will operate based on the probability that a certain state of v and h can be observed.

Ideally, visible and hidden nodes would be dynamically activated (1) or not (0), representing an immense multitude of different machine states.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">However, the last.fm dataset contains total numbers of scrobbles generated per user, per music artist - a direct measure of artist popularity we intend to explore with the RBM. Furthermore, the dataset includes:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Both heavy users, who have generated dozens, even hundreds of thousands of 'scrobbles' for selected artists, and light users, who produced few 'scrobbles' for few artists. The model must ideally not allow that heavy user preferences overshadow those of light users;</li>\n    <li style=\"text-align: justify\">For every user, the number of scrobbles per artist may vary from one to thousands. The model shall ideally not allow high scrobble counts per user to drastically overshadow low scrobble counts per user.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Having said that, instead of feeding the model with simple binary inputs, which would correspond to a set of 'scrobbled' and 'not scrobbled' music artists for a given user, the machine will be supplied with scaled inputs ranging from 0 to 1 for each 'scrobbled' music artist, on a per user basis. For a given user, a scaled number of scrobbles of a given artist close to '0' means that a small number of scrobbles was generated - the user briefly checked on that artist but the return rate was none or very small, a sign of low 'popularity' of that artist for that user. Inversely, a scaled number of scrobbles of a given artist, for a given user, close to '1' means that a large number of scrobbles was collected - the user listened to that artist several times with a high return rate, an indication of high 'popularity' of that artist for that user.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The traditional approach (i.e. assigning 1 to 'scrobbled' artists and '0' to 'not scrobbled' artists) would not bring to the analysis how popular a given artist is for a given user. An artist with 1 scrobble would be given the same weight as an artist with, let's say, 1,000 scrobbles.

Results were satisfactory (i.e. stable minimum losses and recommendations aligned with user profiles) with a minimum of 100 hidden nodes. No significant improvement was verified with larger numbers of hidden nodes;</li>\n    <li>The model accommodates observation batching for training. However, it has been noted over several simulation rounds that more accurate recommendations were obtained at the end with a batch size of 1;</li>\n    <li>Error metrics (Mean Absolute Error, or 'MAbsE') stabilize after 30 to 40 training epochs. A final number of 50 training epochs proved sufficient and was considered in the final release. </li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Recommendations for the selected users were pretty much aligned with their most evident preferences. It shall though be noted that:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>The lists of preferred and recommended artists displayed include only the top 10 in each case. However, these lists are long for some users, case in which artists not displayed, but present in the preferred artist list, certainly have a weight on final recommendations;</li>\n    <li>The scrobble count scaling strategy described in Sections 2.1 and 4 proved effective. Simulations were performed without it, and although error metrics converged as expected, the final recommendations were very much biased with a clear predominance of only the most popular artists in the artist universe.</li>\n</ul>"},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"end_time = datetime.now()\n\nprint('\\nStart time', start_time)\nprint('End time', end_time)\nprint('Time elapsed', end_time - start_time)","execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"\nStart time 2020-10-08 14:13:51.591969\nEnd time 2020-10-08 14:40:43.397521\nTime elapsed 0:26:51.805552\n","name":"stdout"}]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.7.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
