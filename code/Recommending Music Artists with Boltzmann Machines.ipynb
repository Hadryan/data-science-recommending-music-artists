    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">This notebook describes how a simple <b>Boltzmann machine</b> can assist with <b>music artist recommendations</b> based on artist popularity records collected by <b>last.fm</b>, a UK-based music website and app that supplies recommendations based on detailed user profiles constructed from 'scrobbles' - tracks listened to from diverse music streaming apps, like Spotify and SoundHound, and internet radio stations.</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The case study described herein has an educational nuance and aims at highlighting how a simple <b>unsupervised learning</b> solution addresses a specific problem. Actual commercial recommendation platforms are incredibly more powerful, sophisticated, comprehensive and rely on more advanced artificial intelligence technologies. Positioning the Boltzmann machine developed here as an alternative for a real world implementation is definitely not an intent of this exercise.</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The author also highlights specific singularities of this notebook not usually found in traditional machine learning exercises:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Instead of being built upon existing machine learning frameworks, the Boltzmann machine is <b>hard coded as a Python class</b>;</li>\n",
    "    <li style=\"text-align: justify\">In addition to the traditional performance assessment based on accuracy and loss metrics, a <b>subjective test</b> is performed at the end to verify the appropriateness of actual music artist recommendations delivered by the Boltzmann machine to two specific users with different music gender preferences.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Section 1 includes a summarized, brief mathematical description of Boltzmann machines, not intented to be exhaustive and comprehensive at all. Readers interested only in the practical implementation may skip it.</p>\n",

As a result, unsupervised learning machines have distinct architectures and functional principles.

Put simply, in energy based models the system under analysis will always self-adapt to changes in its constituent elements in pursuit of the lowest possible overall compounded energy state. This concept is central in several fields of Physics, from thermodynamycs to quantum mechanics.</p>\n",

Accordingly, <b>hidden nodes</b> might be interpreted as the set of neurons in our brains responsible to process the information received from the neural terminations and take action - always aiming at self-adapting and conducting the organism to the most appropriate state - the 'lowest energy' state - for a given set of external circumstances.</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">A pictorial example: if the neurons located in the optic nerves on and behind our eyes' retina (the 'visible nodes') experience a sudden increase in external light intensity, this information is quickly delivered to the neurons located in the brain's occipital lobe (the 'hidden nodes') who, in turn, process this information and 'instruct' the eye muscles to constrict pupils, so that the amount of light  reaching the retina is reduced and retina cells are preserved. The overall organism optical network is thus taken to a new optimal 'state' that will last until the environment perceived by the visible nodes change again.</p>"

    "    <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Both heavy users, who have generated dozens, even hundreds of thousands of 'scrobbles' for selected artists, and light users, who produced few 'scrobbles' for few artists.

For a given user, a scaled number of scrobbles of a given artist close to '0' means that a small number of scrobbles was generated - the user briefly checked on that artist but the return rate was none or very small, a sign of low 'popularity' of that artist for that user. Inversely, a scaled number of scrobbles of a given artist, for a given user, close to '1' means that a large number of scrobbles was collected - the user listened to that artist several times with a high return rate, an indication of high 'popularity' of that artist for that user.</p>\n",
